Hi, I‚Äôm Parth Gosar üßë‚Äçüî¨

Welcome to my GitHub! I‚Äôm a Master of Science student in Computer Science at USC and a passionate machine learning researcher specializing in biomedical AI, explainable models, and multi-modal data fusion.

üî¨ Featured Research Projects

CancerPredictionModel (Python) (Updated June 2025)Deep learning framework for blood cancer prediction using multi-modal synthetic datasets (histopathology images, WBC time-series, and genomic features). Focuses on bias resilience, robustness, and model interpretability under class imbalance.

SyntheticData-ML (Python) (Updated June 2025)Toolkit for generating reproducible synthetic datasets for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in healthcare. Includes configurable class imbalance and modality ablation.

jain-ai (Python) (Updated Apr 2025)AI pipeline for decoding Jain Prakrit texts, integrating OCR, NLP, and semantic analysis to make ancient manuscripts searchable and accessible.

Additional Highlights

Likhit (JavaScript) (Updated Oct 2023)OCR-based learning platform for handwriting analysis, providing personalized feedback using Python algorithms and GPT-4 driven phrase suggestions.

Goldbach-Conjecture-Analysis (Python)Mathematical analysis of prime gaps using Cram√©r‚Äôs conjecture for a computational exploration of Goldbach‚Äôs conjecture.
